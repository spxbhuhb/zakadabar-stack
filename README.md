Zakadabar is a multiplatform application development library.

## Status

As of now I add breaking changes quite freely as I assume that no-one uses this library beside us. If you use Zakadabar, let me know and
I'll take it into account.

## Documentation

Please visit [zakadabar.io](https://zakadabar.io).

## Gradle

* Add the Maven Central repository if it is not already there:
```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```

* Add a dependency to the commonMain source set dependencies:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain {
            dependencies {
                implementation("hu.simplexion.zakadabar:core:2021.8.30")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
