This example shows how to define your own theme and styles.

**Shortcuts**

* [StyleSamples.kt](src/jsMain/kotlin/zakadabar/samples/mystyle/frontend/StyleSamples.kt)
* [main.kt](src/jsMain/kotlin/main.kt)

**Important Points**

The CSS support is far from complete yet. We haven't added media queries for example, but
we plan do to so.

**Running the Example**

It does not need a backend. To run it, execute this Gradle task. It won't finish,
it just keeps running until you stop it manually.

* 01-beginner / 5-ways-to-html / Tasks / kotlin browser / jsBrowserRun

When it is up and running a web browser opens with the URL: http://localhost:3000

This is where you can see what happens in HtmlSamples application.

You can make the WebPack server refreshing the page automatically by adding "--continuous"
to the program arguments of the IDEA Run Configuration.

**Don't forget to stop other examples before you start a next one.**
