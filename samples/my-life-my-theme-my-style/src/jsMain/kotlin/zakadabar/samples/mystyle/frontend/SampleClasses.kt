 * There is some magic involved here, but you don't have to worry about it. At
 * the end you just use the fields defined here.
 *
 * The important thing is that in the Stack CSS classes are plain old Kotlin classes,
 * you can do whatever you want to do with them.
 *
 * In general we expect to have fields of String type with a value that is known
 * as a CSS class by the browser.
