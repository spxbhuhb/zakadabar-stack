# Choosing the License

While developing the Stack we've constantly battled the problem of licensing.

It would be nice to have an open source license. At least for the basic parts.

Also, it would be nice to have some revenues in case it is used in commercial projects. Not much, mind you, but some.

There are quite a few open source licenses around, but most of them tries to be the synonym of "no charge".

With MIT you basically do whatever you want to do. I've got the feeling, that it is very good for personal and academic projects.

Apache is almost the same. Honestly there was a phase when we've been seriously thinking about Apache, but still, too
easy to leave the original project behind, cut and paste into a commercial product and go on.

More I've been thinking about Apache more I realized: it is for the big boys. IBM, Google, Adobe etc. Do not get mislead
by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). It has a respectable goal and indeed brought a lot of software under the open source 
umbrella, the big Apache projects are usually sponsored by those big companies.

Have you noticed that 3 of the 9 (or so) of the ASF board members do work for Adobe?  (As I write this, according to their 
public bios. Why aren't their bios collected and published on ASF website by the way? Like: click on the name, see the bio.)

The key is that they have so vast resources that supporting those open source projects is simply not a visible expense
for them (I guess).

Of course, they reap very heavy benefits as they get a lot of developers put time and effort into those projects. I really
wonder about the ROI, I wouldn't be suprised to find quite nice numbers.

Anyway, the Apache license is good if you do something that supports your product. For example lots of Kotlin sources
are under Apache 2.0 and that supports the Jetbrains product portfolio very nicely.

However, if you are small, have an idea and are just about to start: Apache is like shooting yourself into the leg.
You need to have a certain mass to use Apache 2.0. If you have it that should be your license of choice.

Anyway, back to us, small company, but (we think :D) hard-working company.

We actually did go to a law firm and asked about licensing. They said: stay away from open source. But I don't want to
stay away from open source. On the other hand I want to protect my work.

So, a compromise has been made, and we released under dual licensing: 

* Affero General Public License 3.0 a.k.a AGPL 3.0
* a business license to get some revenues

We don't know what the future holds. If possible we'll re-license the Stack with a less restrictive license.

Before doing that we still have to work a lot. That's not a problem. Heck, the whole point of the Stack is to make 
work easy and fun.
