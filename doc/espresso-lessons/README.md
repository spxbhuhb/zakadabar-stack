# Espresso Lessons

Espresso lessons are short, light articles about ideas, gotchas, experiences.

They are (hopefully) good to read while having an espresso or relaxing a bit after lunch.

I've shamelessly stolen the title from a climbing book I've read a few years ago:

## Not So Technical

I've just noticed the small sub-title on the book image: "convert stress into comfort". Hey, this whole stack is about that (as Javascript stresses me to no limit).

I guess I'll just copy one of my rants from the earlier version of the projects. :D
