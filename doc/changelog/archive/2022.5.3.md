# 2022.5.3

**NOTE** Changes with marker **very low** and such are technically breaking changes. However, they are
not major modifications and in most cases they should not break anything. Notes after the marker
are the places worth to check. If you extended them you may have to apply the change to your own class also.

## Versions

**changed&&

- upgrade PostgreSQL JDBC to 42.3.4

## Core

**added**

- `ZkTable.sort` - sorts the data of the table (calls `multiSort` when `multiLevel` is true)
- `ZkTable.multiSort` - sorts a multi-level list of rows

**changed**

- columns should call `ZkTable.sort` instead of modifying `fullData` in place **low** (modifying fullData works when `multiLevel` is false)
- made thes functions open in `ZkTable`: `setData`, `redraw`, `addPlaceHolderRow`, `render` 

**fixed**

- sort works for multi-level tables
