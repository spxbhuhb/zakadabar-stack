# Versioning

Zakadabar stack uses the date of the release as version number: YYYY.MM.DD,
where M and D do not contain the leading zeros:

- 2021.5.1
- 2021.12.29

In special cases when an urgent fix is needed, or we provide long-term support
for a specific version, an additional number may be added: YYYY.MM.DD.X

## Deprecations

Deprecations may be introduced at any time. Depending on the weight of the
change we will set and publish the EOL of each deprecation.

## Breaking Changes

As the stack is most probably not used by anyone else besides us, I feel 
pointless to spend effort on scheduling the breaking changes.

I don't have the time to keep different branches alive, so for now
I'll just go on and change things as needed.

When this becomes a real problem, I'll adjust the policy again.
