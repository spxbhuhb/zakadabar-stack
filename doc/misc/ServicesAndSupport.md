# Services And Support

Simplexion Kft. (developer of the Zakadabar Stack) offers business services
related to the stack.

If you would like to get more information about these, please contact us at: 
[sales@simplexion.hu](mailto:sales@simplexion.hu).

Services are available in Hungarian or English.

## Official Support

With official support you can contact us directly, and we reply in timely
manner according to the support agreement. While we try our best to provide 
general support for the community, official support agreements have priority
and allocated support personnel.

## Long Term Support

If you build your development on a specific version of the stack, you can
buy long term support to guarantee that problems will be solved on that
version parallel to the main branch.

## Module Security Review

If you would like to have an open source, Zakadabar based module reviewed from
security point of view, our CISA certified auditors will make sure that the
module is safe for use.

## Training

Online or on-site training for planners, programmers, testers, IT administrators.

## Custom Development

We offer custom development services for customers who have a business idea
but not the means to implement it by themselves. In this service we work with
Agile methodologies to mitigate risks, provide fast feedback loop for the client
and deliver valuable products as soon as possible.
