# Coding conventions

Use FIXME in places where a fix needed before public release.

Use TODO in places where some improvements are possible, but things work without it.

You MUST comment annotations that suppress warnings with the reason.

Don't be that serious, leave some funny comments behind. If you see comments you don't understand at all,
well, there may be two reasons: drinking wine during an evening coding session, or they are in the native
language of the developer who's written the code (these two may go hand-in-hand). For important stuff
please stick to English and be so-serious.
