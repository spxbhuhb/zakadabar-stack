# Switching Views

# Switch Views of the Same Content

It is a common practice to switch views in-place. For example, replace a content
display with an editor.

To add this functionality use a [SwitchView](../../../src/jsMain/kotlin/zakadabar/stack/frontend/builtin/util/SwitchView.kt)

For an example check [EditableText](../../../src/jsMain/kotlin/zakadabar/stack/frontend/builtin/input/EditableText.kt)

# Switch Content in the Same View

There is no pre-made component for this, but you are welcome to commit one.
It is quite easy to write actually.
