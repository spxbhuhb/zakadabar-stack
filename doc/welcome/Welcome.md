# Welcome

Zakadabar is multiplatform application development library written in Kotlin
with the following goals in mind:

- use only Kotlin,
- work with a strict data model:
    - provide easy, idiomatic binding between the model and the UI,
    - provide automatic validation and user feedback from the constraints,
    - have communication automatically generated from the data model,
    - have common UI and server codes generated from the data model,
    - use the exact same data model code everywhere: server, browser, mobile,
- have consistent, modern, customizable UI look and feel,
- minimize the number of dependencies,
- deny-first, allow-explicitly approach in security,
- have up-to-date, easy-to-use documentation.

This site has been built with the stack. Check the [ShowCase](/en/ShowCase) to
see the UI elements the stack contains. The documentation, the demos and the 
example sources can help with the backend.
