# How to contribute

If your contribution is a bugfix, try to [search](https://github.com/spxbhuhb/zakadabar-stack/issues)
if there is already an open ticket and open a new one if not yet opened.

Contributions are made using Github [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests). 

1. [Create](https://github.com/spxbhuhb/zakadabar-stack/compare) a new PR, your PR should request to merge to the **master** branch.
2. Ensure that the description is clear, refer to an existing ticket/bug if applicable.
3. When contributing a new feature, provide motivation and use-cases describing why 
the feature is important enough to be delivered with the stack to everyone. 
4. Adding and updating features require update of the documentation.

# Styleguides

Every new source file should have a copyright header.

Commit messages should be written in English only, should be clear and descriptive, 
written in present tense and using imperative mood ("Fix" instead of "Fixes", "Improve" instead of "Improved").

Add the related bug reference to a commit message (bug number after a hash character between round braces).
