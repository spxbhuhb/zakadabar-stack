# Get Help

Please create
a [new question](https://github.com/spxbhuhb/zakadabar-stack/issues/new?assignees=&labels=help+wanted%2C+question&template=question.md&title=)
on GitHub if you need help. We'll get notified and do our best to give you an answer and/or a solution in a timely
manner.

As of now we do not monitor other channels (Stack Overflow, slack, etc.) We do plan to add a chat feature to the site,
but we are not there yet.
