# Documentation

Please use the side menu to access the documentation.

On mobile, you can open it from the top-left corner.

<div data-zk-enrich="Note" data-zk-flavour="Info" data-zk-title="Optimized for Desktop">

We haven't optimized the documentation for mobile screens yet. In landscape looks more-or-less OK.

Also, the hashtag magic is not perfect yet, if you click on the link and then click on back,
you will get close to where you've been but not exactly there. Sorry about this, we'll
try to fix it.
