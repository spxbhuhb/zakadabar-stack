Hi!

I'm happy to share our project with the Kotlin community. It is a software 
library for full-stack application development.

We wanted to have a solid platform we build our applications on, with the
following goals in mind:

- use only Kotlin,
- work with a strict data model, provide automatic validation and user feedback from the constraints, 
- don't write even a line of communication code while doing application coding,
- have consistent, modern, customizable UI look and feel,
- minimize the number of dependencies,
- deny-first, allow-explicitly approach in security,
- go from an idea to a deployable application in days while having fun programming.

It is by no means perfect nor complete. It contains only what we've needed on the way
for our in-house projects. That said, we think the concept is solid.
