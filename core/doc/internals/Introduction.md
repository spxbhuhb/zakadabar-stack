Hi!

I'm happy to share our project with the Kotlin community. It is a software 
library for full-stack application development.

We wanted to have a solid platform we build our applications on, with the
following goals in mind (we've already reached most of them):

- use only Kotlin,
- work with a strict data model:
    - provide easy, idiomatic binding between the model and the UI,
    - provide automatic validation and user feedback from the constraints,
    - have communication automatically generated from the data model,
    - have common UI and server codes generated from the data model,
    - use the exact same data model code everywhere: server, browser, mobile.
- have consistent, modern, customizable UI look and feel,
- minimize the number of dependencies,
- deny-first, allow-explicitly approach in security,
- have current, easy-to-use documentation.

It is by no means perfect nor complete, we are at the starting point. It
contains only what we've needed on the way for our in-house projects.

That said, we think that the concept is solid, and we reached the point when the 
feedback from the community can help us to smooth the rough edges.
