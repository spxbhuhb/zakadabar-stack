# Project Status

Project status is **alpha**.

Some migration steps may be needed between releases. We will try really hard to
keep these to minimum and give you a clear upgrade path or an upgrade script.

Our goal is to move out of alpha status by end of August 2021.

Check the [Roadmap](/en/Roadmap.md) to see what we plan.
