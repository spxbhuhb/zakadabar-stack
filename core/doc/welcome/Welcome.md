# Welcome

Zakadabar Stack is a Kotlin software library for full-stack application
development. The server side uses Ktor, the browser frontend is implemented from
scratch, the mobile clients build on their native environment with the help of
the stack. This combination lets us take advantage of the full power of Kotlin
Multiplatform, which is awesome.

You are actually trying it right now!

This site has been built with the stack. Check the [ShowCase](/en/ShowCase) to
see the UI components. The documentation, the demos and the example sources can
help with the backend.

Project status of the stack is **alpha**. This means that some migration steps
may be needed between releases.
See [components stability](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/evolution/components-stability.html)
.

The stack is by no means perfect nor complete, but we think it shows great
promise. We work every day to make that promise reality.

## Main Features

### Ease of Use

Designed for easy use by users, planners, programmers, testers, IT
administrators. Support cognitive associations: if you feel it should be there,
it will be there.

### Level of Integration

Everything is aware of the common data model. Communication, data validation,
synthetic UI elements are automatically created from your data model. You write
what has to be written, not the boilerplate.

### Fast Implementation

Create a production ready, customized, stylish, Docker deployable, full-stack,
full Kotlin application in 15 minutes. Use the application template for quick
start, grow as needed.

### Dependency Minimum

Keep your dependencies to the minimum. Minimize problems with security,
upgrades, integration.

### Consistency

Get used to convenient, same-everywhere approaches. If it works like that here,
it will work like that there.

### Documentation

Have up-to-date, detailed, structured documentation, with working, cut & paste
ready, one-click-away example codes.

### Help Given

Ask us questions, we'll answer. We are quality extremists. Time allows
everything will be perfect in itself, but until then we'll help.

### Bug Source Elimination

Eliminate common sources of bugs by strict, consistent integration. Have you
ever mistyped a CSS class name? Not anymore.

### Free Will

We design for extensibility, let you choose your way. We provide concepts and
implementations of those concepts. When you are not happy with the default, you
can replace it anyway.
