# Welcome

Zakadabar Stack is a Kotlin software library for full-stack application
development, with the following goals in mind:

- use only Kotlin,
- work with a strict data model, provide automatic validation and user feedback from the constraints,
- don't write even a line of communication code while doing application coding,
- have consistent, modern, customizable UI look and feel,
- minimize the number of dependencies,
- deny-first, allow-explicitly approach in security,
- go from an idea to a deployable application in days.

This site has been built with the stack. Check the [ShowCase](/en/ShowCase) to
see the UI elements the stack contains. The documentation, the demos and the 
example sources can help with the backend.

## Main Features

### Ease of Use

Designed for easy use by users, planners, programmers, testers, IT
administrators. Support cognitive associations: if you feel it should be there,
it will be there.

### Level of Integration

Everything is aware of the common data model. Communication, data validation,
synthetic UI elements are automatically created from your data model. You write
what has to be written, not the boilerplate.

### Fast Implementation

Create a production ready, customized, stylish, Docker deployable, full-stack,
full Kotlin application in 15 minutes. Use the application template for quick
start, grow as needed.

### Dependency Minimum

Keep your dependencies to the minimum. Minimize problems with security,
upgrades, integration.

### Consistency

Get used to convenient, same-everywhere approaches. If it works like that here,
it will work like that there.

### Documentation

Have up-to-date, detailed, structured documentation, with working, cut & paste
ready, one-click-away example codes.

### Help Given

Ask us questions, we'll answer. We are quality extremists. Time allows
everything will be perfect in itself, but until then we'll help.

### Bug Source Elimination

Eliminate common sources of bugs by strict, consistent integration. Have you
ever mistyped a CSS class name? Not anymore.

### Free Will

We design for extensibility, let you choose your way. We provide concepts and
implementations of those concepts. When you are not happy with the default, you
can replace it anyway.
