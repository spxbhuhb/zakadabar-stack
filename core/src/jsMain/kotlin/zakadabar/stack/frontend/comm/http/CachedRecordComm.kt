/**
 * A cache for objects accessed with a [RecordComm]. This is basically a
 * wrapper around [RecordComm], that caches objects on the fly.
 *
 * Be careful with this one, you should probably use a [RecordComm].
 *
 * Caching objects in general is not a good idea as it is very easy
 * to use up a lot of memory. However, sometimes it is very useful.
 *
 * For example feeding selects which display the same data all over the
 * application, the list of buildings for example. Or in comments which
 * displays the user name and avatar.
 *
 * Using a cache has to be considered case-by-case basis, again, be careful.
