/**
 * Base class for layouts of the application. Typically there are only

 *
 * Layouts are initialized when they are first used. Initialization:
 *
 * * calls [init]
 * * adds the [element] to the document body
 *
 * When the URL changes, the [Application]:
 *
 * * calls [AppRouting.onNavStateChange],which:
 *     * when the state points to a [Crud], calls [Crud.route]
 *     * when not a crud, calls [AppRouting.route]
 *     * after the route call returns:
 *     * if value of [AppRouting.layout]
 *         * is the same as [AppRouting.activeLayout], calls [resume]
 *         * is different than the active layout
 *             * calls [pause] of the old layout
 *             * calls [resume] of the new layout
 *             * sets [AppRouting.activeLayout] to the new layout
