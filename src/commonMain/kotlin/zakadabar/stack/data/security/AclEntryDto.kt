/**
 * An access control list entry. Used for fine grained security checks.
 *
 * @property  subjectId  The id of the entity this entry grants/denies access for.
 * @property  access     A free-form access type name. There are some common names but
 *                       anything is acceptable as long as the backend recognizes it.
 * @property  allow      When true, the access type is allowed, when false it is
 *                       explicitly denied. False stops the access check process and
 *                       denies that type of access immediately.
