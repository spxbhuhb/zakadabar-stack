# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

In general, we do not provide patches for previous releases. This is because you (and we) should keep our software
up-to-date.

If you really need a patch for an older version (large, old codebase comes to mind),
please write to security@simplexion.hu explaining why you need that. We'll try to work out a solution.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you notice a vulnerability in Zakadabar Stack, please send an e-mail about the description of the vulnerability
to security@simplexion.hu.

The fix will be top priority and will be included in the next release.
