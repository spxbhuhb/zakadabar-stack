# Markdown

## Syntax

The components can process GitHub flavoured markdown sources with a few 
additional features. These are described below.

### Images

```

## Add Notes

<div data-zk-enrich="Note" data-zk-flavour="Info" data-zk-title="Start With Empty Line">

To use markdown in the first line of your note, start with an empty line. If it is
not there, the first line won't be interpreted as markdown content.

</div>

```text
<div data-zk-enrich="Note" data-zk-flavour="Success" data-zk-title="Try It">

</div>
```
